## Overview

- **Role:** Founder and Community Leader
- **Time:** 2003 - Present
- **Status:** Active

## Description

In 2003, I discovered the art of parkour and became one of its earliest practitioners in Scotland. Recognising the potential of this exciting new discipline to create a strong, supportive community, I took the initiative to establish Aberdeen Parkour.

Originally, Aberdeen Parkour started off as Nokizaru - the name we gave the group of friends we were training parkour with. Eventually this evolved into Aberdeen Parkour as the community grew and I sought to get as many people involved locally as possible.

Over the years, this community has evolved and adapted to the digital age, migrating from IRC, websites and forums to social media platforms. As the founder and leader, I've been responsible for designing and managing multiple websites, community forums, and groups. I've also organised thousands of meetups and training sessions, fostering a culture of support, camaraderie, and shared growth.

## Looking Forward

As I no longer live in Aberdeen I do not play an active role in the community and only occasionally help moderate.

My goals shifted to further promoting the sport within Scotland and beyond, to foster a culture that values health, fitness, and personal growth. Projects like [Ukemi](/projects/ukemi) and [MuvMentor](/projects/muvmentor) are a direct result of this.
