## Description

The Balance Marathon is an annual community art project that aims to raise awareness around mental health, connect the global movement community and improve well-being through action.

The event began with the goal of David Banks (Ukemi) completing a marathon (26.2 miles / 42.2 kilometers) on a handrail. When an injury prevented the original attempt, we adapted the concept into a larger community event with a dual purpose: promoting mental health awareness and strengthening the global parkour community.

It is a call to action for the Parkour community worldwide to question the philosophy of "ÃŠtre fort pour Ãªtre utile" ("Being strong to be useful") and how we use this in our practice.

Each year [Ukemi](/projects/ukemi) runs the event alongside [Free Your Instinct](http://freeyourinstinct.org), a charity that uses parkour as a part of their mental health programs, and we select an additional international charity to support.

Between the 10th and 16th of May people from round the world came together tto raise money and awareness for mental health. Working together to balance the equivalent distance of the Nullarbor Straight - one of the longest straight roads in the world at 146.6km (91 miles).

The total distance donated was 334 kilometres with 228 participants!

We raised over Â£5000 to support mental health throughout parkour.
This has funded:

- ðŸ’¥ 2 months organisation costs for wallrunners
- ðŸ’¥ 2 x 12 week courses with FYI for at risk young people
- ðŸ’¥ In addition to supporting the work at Soulparkour and Parkour Visions

## Looking Forward:

As we continue to organise the Balance Marathon annually, our vision is to further expand its reach, increase participation, and raise more funds to support mental health programs.

We are also committed to reinforcing the philosophy of "ÃŠtre fort pour Ãªtre utile" within the parkour community, encouraging practitioners to leverage their strength for societal good.
