description: "Ukemi is the worlds first parkour/freerunning card game. It is a random chance movement game that improves the player's ability to assess risk and develop quality movement. The base movements are derived from the disciplines of parkour, freerunning and broader movement culture.  My team and I took an idea and developed it into a product, I took the lead on the design and branding and over 7 months we created two prototypes, funded the project through crowdfunding pre-sales, sourced our supplier in China and brought it to market.  The game is now in use in over 15 international countries and we have received only positive feedback so far."
