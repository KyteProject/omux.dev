## Overview

- **Status:** Handed off to new organisers

## Description

"Ukemi" is the world's first parkour/freerunning card game. It is a random chance movement game that improves players' ability to assess risk and develop quality movement. The base movements derive from the disciplines of parkour, freerunning, and broader movement culture.

The idea for the game was born within my company, Ukemi, in collaboration with [Sam Mcfarlane](https://www.instagram.com/circus_sam/). From concept to completion, the development process took seven months. I led the design and branding, creating two prototypes, initiating a successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, sourcing our supplier in China, and finally bringing the game to market in December 2018.

## Gameplay and Components

Ukemi includes a variety of cards:

- **30 Movement Cards:** These cards depict the movements and tricks players perform.
- **20 Condition Cards:** These cards are modifiers that attach a condition to a movement.
- **20 Wild Cards:** These cards are like Condition Cards but harder and more unusual.
- **12 Blank Cards:** These cards are blank for players to customize.
- **2 Info Cards:** These cards provide information and do not play a part in the game1.

The game is designed to be as flexible as parkour itself. We encourage players to experiment and discover new play styles. To help them get started, we provide guidelines and a default method of play1.

## Impact and Reception

Since its launch, Ukemi has been sold to traceurs all over the world, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We've sold over 1,000 units of Ukemi, and the game is now played in over 40 international countries.

As the world's first parkour/movement card game, Ukemi is a testament to innovation in game design and our passion for promoting and developing movement culture.

## Looking Forward:

The positive international response to Ukemi has been invigorating, and we are excited for the future of this project. We envision the game continuing to evolve, just as the practice of parkour does. We aim to incorporate feedback from our global player base to refine and expand the game.

Finally, we are also considering the development of digital versions of the game, to make Ukemi accessible to even more people around the world and to create new interactive experiences for our players.
