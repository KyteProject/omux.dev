Ukemi is a company that I co-founded with two friends as a platform to introduce and promote our passion projects.

Our primary goal is to encourage physical activity in urban areas, fostering a healthier society through digital design, product creation, and community art development.

We strive to challenge and reshape the prevailing health and safety culture, to inspire play, and to demystify fitness and movement.

## Projects

During my time with Ukemi, a company I co-founded with two friends, we've managed to achieve some significant milestones!

### Website

Leveraging our shared passion for parkour and movement culture, we've designed, developed, and deployed a custom website, blog, project, and e-commerce platform, allowing us to reach a global audience.

Static website with ecommerce and multiple data sources.

**Architecture:** `Web`, `Monolith`, `Serverless`

**Technology:** `Gatsby`, `React`, `GraphQL`, `Bootstrap`, `SASS` structure. `Formik` and `Yup` for validation. `Stripe` for payment processing. `Ghost`, and `Forestry` as content API's, `AWS`, `S3`, and `CloudFront` for static/CDN media serving. `APIGateway`, `Lambda`, `SES`, for serverless form and email functions. `AWS CodeBuild/Pipeline` for continuous integration and auto build.

### Card Game

One of our most notable accomplishments was the creation of the world's first parkour and movement card game, "Ukemi." This unique product, inspired by our personal experiences and expertise in parkour, has seen tremendous success.

We've sold over 1,000 units, reaching enthusiasts in more than 30 countries.

### Youth Urban Games

We're also proud of our role in the Youth Urban Games, Scotland's largest charitable parkour spectator event. As the event's designers and managers, we helped attract over 7,000 spectators and raised over £50,000 for charity.

This event highlighted our ability to bring the parkour community together, and demonstrated our commitment to giving back to society.

### Movement Card

In addition, we've also been involved in several other projects such as The Movement Card project, for which we designed the physical card and developed the website.

### Rail Balance Marathon

The Balance Marathon is an annual community art project that aims to raise awareness around mental health, connect the global movement community and improve well-being through action.

It is a call to action for the Parkour community worldwide to question the philosophy of "Être fort pour être utile" ("Being strong to be useful") and how we use this in our practice.

### BAME and LGBTQIA+ Community Englagement

Moreover, we're proud to have played a role in nurturing diversity within the parkour community.

We've supported five members from the BAME and LGBTQIA+ communities in reaching professional parkour coaching levels, reflecting our commitment to inclusivity.

## Background

As founders, we have each been practicing parkour for over 15 years and have witnessed the growth of the Scottish parkour scene firsthand.

Our experiences encompass everything from traveling and teaching classes to organising national events, creating web resources, and performing.

Our shared vision and experiences have brought us together to apply our traceur vision beyond the practice itself and to transform the city into a more active, engaging space.

We are excited about the future of cities, movement, and play, and look forward to more collaborations and projects.
