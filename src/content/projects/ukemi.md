description: "Designed and developed the company website. Currently, HTML/CSS/Javascript based on the Bootstrap framework. Later integrated with separately installed Wordpress blog and developing a custom theme to match the main website.  Currently, I am in the process of rebuilding the website to use server-side rendering with React.js for better performance and maintainability. This also allows for API development and integration with future projects."
