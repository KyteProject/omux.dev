description: "Working in collaboration with Sport Inspired and Scottish Canals charities the Youth Urban Games was a fantastic success. The project was to design, develop, and project manage the parkour side of the event. This involved developing the formats, designing the course, recruiting athletes, marketing and securing participants, and managing everything on the day."
