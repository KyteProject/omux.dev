## Description

The Youth Urban Games (YUG), held on August 25, 2018, marked Scotland's first urban sports festival, a unique event that brought together some of the country's most talented young athletes to celebrate Scotland's Year of Young People 2018.

The festival was hosted in Glasgow, where a derelict site on the banks of the Forth & Clyde Canal was transformed into a vibrant events space featuring parkour, skateboarding, and BMX showcases.

The event, designed by a steering group of Glasgow's young people, aimed to put Scotland's youth in the spotlight, celebrating their talents, contributions, and creating new opportunities for them to shine.

More than 200 of the best young BMX, parkour, and skateboard athletes in Scotland showcased their skills, with the parkour athletes flipping, jumping, and rolling through a series of demos.

The festival also included public try-out sessions, a street food village, and art installations, all part of the inaugural Youth Urban Games.

This community-focused event was a unique and impactful project that not only celebrated youth athleticism but also transformed public spaces, promoting urban sports and healthy lifestyles among Scotland's young people

## Ukemi's Involvement

Ukemi played a significant role in the organisation and execution of the Youth Urban Games. The company was responsible for designing and managing the parkour section of the event.

This undertaking included the creation and delivery of the largest temporary parkour park ever in Scotland, done with support from AiM. The parkour event featured over 200 participants and 15 high-level athletes.

The event was not only a showcase of urban sports but also a charitable endeavour, successfully raising over Â£50,000 for charity.

## Looking Forward:

The success of the Youth Urban Games sets a strong foundation for future events. Given the positive reception and the substantial impact on the community, it is clear that there is a demand and appreciation for urban sports festivals.

As such, there is potential for the Youth Urban Games to grow in the coming years, continuing to promote urban sports and foster community engagement.

It also provides me with a proven track record and experience to leverage in future projects and collaborations.
