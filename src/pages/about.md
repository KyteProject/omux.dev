Welcome to my personal site!

I'm Dan, a versatile full-stack software engineer with a passion for entrepreneurship, music production, parkour, skateboarding, and bouldering.

Here, I delve into a variety of topics that currently capture my interest, including software architecture, system design, synthesis, music production, and cybersecurity.

At the moment, I'm working on a bunch of projects professionally and personally, mostly using Typescript and Go. If you're curious, feel free to explore my blog posts and check out the projects I've been working on.
