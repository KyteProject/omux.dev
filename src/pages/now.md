After what felt like a particularly uneventful year, these first few months of 2024 have been a breath of fresh air. Here's a quick summary of what's happening in my life recently.

## Things I'm Proud Of:

#### 1. **Relationship Milestones**

Passing the one-year mark and moving in together has probably been the biggest improvement in my life.

#### 2. **Moving to Edinburgh**

Moving to a new city has injected a sense of adventure and excitement that has been missing for a while.

#### 3. **Career Progression**

I'm starting a new job as a Tech Lead at [Push](https://pushentertainment.com/). It's rare in tech to actually enjoy the interview process, but I can honestly say that I did.

## Things I'm Working On:

#### 1. **Music Production**

In typical ADHDer fashion, I have an abundance of projects that are a few steps from the finish line. I'm aiming to complete and release at least four songs this year.

#### 2. **AWS Solutions Architect Certification**

This is something I've been wanting to do for a while, and I'm finally in a position where I can dedicate the time to it.

#### 3. **Driver's Licence**

I've probably had about 25 hours of lessons over the years, but I've never been able to commit to it. I'm determined to get it done this year.
