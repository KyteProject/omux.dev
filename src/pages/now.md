Now that I'm settled into Edinburgh and my new job, I've been reflecting on the past year and thinking about what direction I want to take. Here's a quick update:

## Things I'm Proud Of

#### 1. **Music Production**

Recently one of my tracks was released by a label as part of a remix VA. It was a huge milestone for me, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.

#### 2. **Career Success**

Within the first 4 months in my new role, I've already made a significant impact. I've been able to help the team with a number of technical challenges, and I've helped deliver a large project to one of our biggest clients!

## Things I'm Working On

#### 1. **Music Production**

In typical ADHDer fashion, I have an abundance of projects that are a few steps from the finish line.

#### 2. **Homelab**

I've started building out my homelab beyond just the Proxmox server I had running before. I'm currently working on setting up a Kubernetes cluster and I'm aiming to write some more blog posts about my journey.

#### 3. **Driver's Licence**

I've made great progress on this goal, and I'm expecting to pass my test in January!
