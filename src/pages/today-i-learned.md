"Learn in Public" is a concept that gained noteriety after [Shawn Wang (Swyx)](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) wrote an emphatic article rallying people to create and not just consume.

The idea is simple: **_share what you learn_**. It's a way to hold yourself accountable, to document your progress, and to help others who are on the same journey. Doing so maximises your learning potential and helps solidify the knowledge you've gained.
